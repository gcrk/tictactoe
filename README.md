# TIC TAC TOE for NES

This is my first project during my GA Software Engineer Immersive course.


## Web address

If you want to play, you can visit my game at this address [Tic Tac Toe](https://gcrk.github.io/tictactoe/)


## Gameplay

It's the simplest game ever but if you play against an average opponent you'll never win (cheat codes will be implemented later)

So the rules are on the page, Cross start first.
when anyone win of it's a draw, just click the board to replay.
The game keep the score until you click the New Game button.


## Design

I tried to recreate an old school NES style design with a 8bits font and glowing effects.
I use a 8bits stye font from google.
A use a lot of text-shadow CSS and blinking animation to recreate a glowing effect like old school arcade game.
There is a hidden button you can find to get a nicer effect on the title.


## How it works

To make it works, I choose to store each play in 2 Objects, one for cross and the other one for circle.
There is a main function to play on the board and other functions to check if there is a winner, wich turn is it, render the score and restart the game.

## Next steps

I'm working on a single player mode with a CPU player with choice of easy or hard mode.
